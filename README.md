Hello Traveler!

This project will highlight the early stages of learning HTML. In later iterations it will be
properly styled with CSS and even include functionality with JS. 
It is a simple recipe website.
It will consist of a main page with links to a few recipes. (hopefully the links will be working by the time you read this! :D)
